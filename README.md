# game-of-life
This is inspired by a code kata exercise I worked on a couple of years ago with Najati Imam. The first round we designed a typical, object oriented solution. That version - which unfortunately I didn't keep, consisted of several classes and files. Not bad, but we were stuck with a fixed world size and a bunch of wasted object instantiation. This code is from the second iteration where we deliberately avoided objected oriented design, taking a data-centered, functional approach that radically simplified the design. The result is straight forward and more flexible (if slightly less readable codewise). It's also faster and lighter in terms of resources.

Run the code from the command line with 'ruby game_of_life.rb' The program iterates over successive generations displaying octothorps for living cells, as well a count of current living cells. From the game_of_life.rb script, the run_game method is called with a seed list (an list of tuples indicating the x, y location of living cells). Optionally, display width and height, and the generation time can be passed to this method as arguments. The default signature is run_game(seed_list, width=60, height=35, turn_length=0.3).

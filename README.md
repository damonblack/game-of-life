# game-of-life
This is inspired by a code kata exercise I worked on a couple of years ago with Najati Imam. The first round we designed a typical, object oriented solution. That version - which unfortunately I didn't keep, consisted of several classes and files. Not bad, but we were stuck with a fixed world size and a bunch of wasted object instantiation. This code is from the second iteration where we deliberately avoided objected oriented design, taking a data-centered, functional approach that radically simplified the design. The result is straight forward and more flexible (if slightly less readable codewise). It's also faster and lighter in terms of resources.
